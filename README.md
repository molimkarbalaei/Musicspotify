# ðŸ“£ **Summary**

This application (**MusicSpotify**) was built using _React_ (Custom Hooks, Redux), React-Router-Dom,Vite, React-icons, Light/Dark Theme, Tailwind,Dynamic Routes, React-icons, API, Hosting and more!

---

I used Tailwind CSS for this project and I really enjoyed using it. I used styled components in my previous project, but I have now converted all my projects to Tailwind CSS for ease of use.

I used Rapid API and shazamCore for fetching the data.[link](https://rapidapi.com/tipsters/api/shazam-core)

I used Vite instead of create-react-app. [link](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite2.html)
